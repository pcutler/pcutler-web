=== Skematik ===

Hi. I created this theme out of a personal passion for WordPress and all that it can do, and a respect for the community that has evolved around it. As a result this framework stays true to two principlesâ€¦

1) It is 100% GPL licensed, the way everything surrounding WordPress should be
2) It is built as a framework first, meaning all decisions about it's direction are made from the standpoint that it won't compromise but rather enhance a developer's ability to build child themes and extensions for it, and...
3) It highlights some of the special niches that have meant the most to me over my years developing for WordPress. Specifically, these are eCommerce, BuddyPress and responsive design.

I hope you enjoy creating with Skematik and appreciate the path we've chosen for it's development. Support, demos, child themes, extensions and a growing community of developers and content-creators can all be found at http://skematiktheme.com.

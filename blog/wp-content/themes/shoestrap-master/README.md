# [Shoestrap WordPress Theme](http://www.shoestrap.org/)

The master branch is the HEAD where all the development takes place (based on Bootstrap 3).
This is NOT a stable release and has lots of bugs.
Use at your own risk and report any bugs you may find back here. :)

If you're looking for a stable version of this theme, you can download the [Legacy](https://github.com/aristath/shoestrap/tree/legacy) branch which is based on Bootstrap 2.
